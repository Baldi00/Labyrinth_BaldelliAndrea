## How to play
- Player can move one tile at a time using WASD or shoot an arrow in the four directions using IJKL
- Tunnels are traversed automatically by both player and arrows
- If player enters a teleport area it gets teleported
- If player enters a well, meets the monster, finishes the arrows or gets hit by an arrow it loses
- If player hits the monster with an arrow it wins
- You can play in a precomputed maze or generate a new one each time. You can also customize the maze parameters
- You can play with other players on the same screen by pressing the "Add Player" button (you can add as many player as you like)

[^1]: Since we haven't studied how to make a multiplayer game yet, instead of making a bad implementation I preferred to make just a local shared screen multiplayer.
The architecture of the code is designed for multiplayer so it can be easily converted into an online multiplayer game.
